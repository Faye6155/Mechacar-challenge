# Mechacar-challenge

Delivery 1
- Vichele weight, AWD, and Spoiler angle provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the database
- P-value is less than 0 (5.35e-11), the slope is not equal to zero
- R squared value is 71.49% of time, the predictions would be correc using this liner model

Delivery 2

- Lot 1 and lot 2 are very similar, Lot 3 has smaller mean with bigger variance and standard deviation

Delivery 3

- PSI= 0.06028
- LOT 1 PSI=1
- LOT 2 PSI=0.6072
- LOT 3 PSI=0.04168
- LOT 3 has lover mean and high variance, therefore it is under-performing.

Study Design

- ANOVA TEST can be applied to see if the means from multiple different samples are significantly similar or different.
- If p-vavlue is greater than 0.5, MechaCar has same or similar performance within these categories
- If p-vavlue is less than 0.5, MechaCar is significantly different in those categories
- If significat different, compare with the average of MechaCar, below is worse, above is better compare to the competitors.
